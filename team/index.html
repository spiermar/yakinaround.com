        <p class="lead">Martin Spier</p>
        <p>His natural habitat is behind a large computer monitor, solving the most ridiculously complex performance problems for a little company called Netflix, or building an amazing product at his new startup, HandsOn.TV. He is the last person you would expect to see drinking yak’s milk in the Mongolian steppe, but he loves to bloody travel and is always the first to say yes to a stupidly ridiculous adventure like this.</p>
        <p>Currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area, his 6th city and 4th country in the past 15 years. He traveled to over 100 places in 20 different countries and still feels this is just a blip on all there is to see in this world.</p>
        <p>He suffers from Acute Boredom Syndrome, causing him to get extremely bored of staying in the same place for too long. This adventure is the perfect cure and the amount of places, cultures and people we meet on our way will change everything. And who knows, he might just move indefinitely for a Ger in Inner Mongolia after all this is done!</p>

        <p>Lives in Nova Petrópolis, a small german town in south Brazil. Is the founder of Nordweg, a brand of genuine leather backpacks, loves traveling, languages and technology.</p>
        <p>Igor joined the rally because he was looking for an adventure in 2015 to run away from the always planned, secure and comfortable life. He likes the unexpected and believes that those are times that most of the unforgettable experiences and learnings in life happen. That’s when he feels the most alive and the Mongol Rally sounded like the perfect adventure.</p>

        <p>At day, a full time photographer born and raised in São Paulo. At night, an imaginary rock star that can’t even play one single instrument. After years dealing with paperwork behind a desk, he chose to combine work and pleasure as a lifestyle.</p>
        <p>He really believes that people must do things guided by heart, and that's why he jumped into the rally idea at the very second he heard about it. Why? To see, think and feel new things and keep himself open-minded.</p>

        <p>Currently lives in Rio Grande, a town in the very southern region of Brazil. Also lived in Porto Alegre and São Paulo and is moving to Italy a few months after the rally, totally changing the direction of his life. Feels like this is a great opportunity for change.</p>
