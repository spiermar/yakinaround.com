        <p class="lead">A 3,000km Indian adventure in a 7 horsepower glorified lawnmower. The Rickshaw Run is easily the least sensible thing to do with two weeks.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">No set route, no back-up, no way of knowing if you're going to make it. The only certainty is that you will get lost, you will get stuck and you will break down.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">It's just you and your mates in a wholly unsuitable vehicle, traversing the subcontinent enduring whatever shit the road throws at you.</p>

        <p class="lead">If God had made machines he probably wouldn't have bothered with a Rickshaw. But as with so many other things he would have been wrong. Essentially, it's not a very good idea. It's not very fast, it smells, it falls over when you go round corners, it breaks downs more often than an emo teenager and a days driving feels like you've been kicked up the arse by an elephant. But somehow all this makes them better.</p>
        <p class="lead">And so they are, unquestionably, the greatest vehicle on the planet. To prove it we surveyed nearly some of the people at HQ and 100% agree. They are the only way to try and cross the Subcontinent, and if you do make it across, you'll never want to drive anything as pedestrian as a car for the rest of your life.</p>
