        <br><br><br>
        <p class="lead text-center">The Rickshaw Run is a 3,000km Indian adventure in a 7 horsepower glorified lawnmower.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead text-center">No set route, no back-up, no way of knowing if we're going to make it. The only certainty is that we will get lost, we will get stuck and we will break down, multiple times.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead text-center">It will be just ourselves (and another 85 teams of unprepared adventurers),  in a wholly unsuitable vehicle, traversing the whole subcontinent, enduring whatever shit the road throws at us.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead text-center">We will be facing the bone-shaking Jaisalmer - Kochi route, in the April 2017 run. Test drive starts on March 31st and the adventure launches on April 2nd.</p>
        <p class="lead text-center">A worthy finish-line party awaits us in Fort Kochi on April 15th, assuming we can actually get there!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead text-center">With us luck!</p>

        <h1>The Un-Route</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">The un-route is a simple yet devastatingly effective concept. There's a start line and a finish line. Everything in between is up to us.</p>
        <p class="lead">To attain this nirvana-like state of ignorant adventuring bliss we must ignore it all. Bollocks to travel guides and research. The less we know the better!</p>
        <p class="lead">Trying to tame the beast that is the Rickshaw Run is just not going to work. Crafting a daily route is pointless. Trying to work out where we’ll stay every night is idiotic. Detailed planning of any kind is highly likely to go completely to shit by the second day on the road. India will see to that.</p>
        <p class="lead">Having a set route and being told where to go is tremendously boring, hence, the marvelous un-route. There’s a starting point and a finishing point, and in between it’s all up to us and our sense of adventure.</p>
        <p class="lead">Between mystical Jaisalmer and tropical Kochi there's a whole world of adventure to be had and it will be up to us to get up from our asses and find it!</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="lead">Luckily for your, our dear follower, you wiil be able to laugh uncontrollably from the safety of your comfy chair, while following our misadventures in our real-time tracking map (coming soon) and social networks!</p>

        <p class="lead">If God had made machines he probably wouldn't have bothered with a Rickshaw. But as with so many other things he would have been wrong. </p>
        <p class="lead">Essentially, it's not a very good idea. It's not very fast, it smells, it falls over when you go round corners, it breaks downs more often than an emo teenager and a days driving feels like you've been kicked up the ass by an elephant. But somehow all this makes them better.</p>
        <p class="lead">These wonders of the motorised world were invented by a chap called Corradine D'Ascanio who also invented some quite resplendent flying machines (one we note has three wheels) and designed the Vespa scooter before his career topping moment of bringing the Piaggio Ape to humanity in 1947.</p>

        <p class="lead">Later this trusty marvel was licensed to a little known Indian company by the name of Bajaj.</p>
