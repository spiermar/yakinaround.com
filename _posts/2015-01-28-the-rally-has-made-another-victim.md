Well, not yet, but we found our third and (possibly) last team member! Neto Macedo, an amazing photographer from Montes Claros, Brazil. You can see some of Neto's work at [netomacedo.com](http://www.netomacedo.com/).

I can't stress enough how happy we are with Neto's decision to join the team. We will be adventuring into amazing places, experiencing a multitude of cultures and having someone like Neto to help us capture every moment is really amazing!

It's not just about being a talented photographer, but the fondness for traveling and the need for adventure, and it's not easy to find someone like that.

Welcome to the Team Neto!
