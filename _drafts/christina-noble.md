Hello! I'm inspired by the work that Christina Noble Children's Foundation do for disadvantaged and street children, so I wanted to raise funds for their projects in Vietnam and Mongolia. Please help me help them by giving whatever you can using the 'Give Now' button. The more people that know about Christina Noble Children's Foundation, the greater their impact, so please also spread the word by sharing my page with your friends and family. Thank you in advance for your generosity, it means a lot!

£1.50 will purchase 2 preventative blood tests for children in Mongolia.
£5 is all it costs to hold a birthday party at our Blue Skies Ger Village in Mongolia, big smiles all round!
£10 to buy teaching materials for bakery lessons at the Boys Prison Mongolia.
£20 a month to sponsor a child in Vietnam or Mongolia enabling them to go to school and receive an education.
£80 to buy a new bicycle with safety helmet for a child in Vietnam making the sometimes long journey to school a little easier!
